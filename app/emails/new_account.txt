Hello,

Thank you for choosing to try out our monitoring service. Please ensure you have read and accept the following key points before using this beta service:
 - You may NOT use this service on production servers, or any server with important data
 - This free beta may be revoked at any time and monitoring data destroyed
 - You may receive large numbers of false positive emails

That aside, I hope you enjoy the beta. It's "rough and ready" at the moment but new features are being added regularly.

You have been assigned an account with the following details:
Login URL: __URL__/clients/login
Username: __EMAIL__
Password: __PASSWORD__
Max servers: __SERVERS__

Note that we will likely increase your server limit during the beta. The limit is small now to load test the platform.

If you have any feedback, PLEASE submit it - it will help make the service much better: http://community.loadingdeck.com/forum/monitoring. The following additions are currently planned:
 - Predicted metrics
 - Application response time monitoring+intelligence
 - Panic mode
 - API and/or public stats
 - Alert rules

Best regards,
